> NOTE: If you are interested in the Notion tooling around the [Notion Weekly Template](https://kevinjalbert.com/my-weekly-notion-setup/) from [kevinjalbert.com](https://kevinjalbert.com/) then you should look at the historic [snapshot of the repository](https://github.com/kevinjalbert/notion-toolbox/tree/63d8bf16670b44ec355132d5f251e0728fc5cd78). This project no longer uses the tailored template, and instead is moving in a more flexible direction.

This is a collection of [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) tools that work in tandem together.

## Tools

The following tools are available. Each tool has a README file present in its corresponding sub-directory.

- [Server](server/) application
  - Provides a REST API to perform CRUD operations with blocks and collections
  - Useful to connect with webhooks (e.g., IFTTT)
  - Opens integrations with Google Assistant, iOS Shortcuts, and Android Tasker


## History of this Repository
<details>
<summary>Toggle to read about this...</summary>

For a good part of 2019, I focused heavily on my [Notion[Referral]](https://www.notion.so/?r=6b8d609eb50943419db4d87c67fa558e) setup. I personally feel that this was time well invested, akin to a craftsman refining his tools.

- I created a [specific weekly/daily template](https://kevinjalbert.com/my-weekly-notion-setup/) to satisfy some of my needs and give structure to Notion.
- I created an integration with [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) called [`alfred-notion`](https://github.com/kevinjalbert/alfred-notion) ([blog post](https://kevinjalbert.com/integrating-notion-with-alfred/)).
- I created a server web application called [`notion-heroku`](https://github.com/kevinjalbert/notion-heroku) that interacts with [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) and Google Assistant ([blog post](https://kevinjalbert.com/integrating-notion-with-google-assistant/)).
- I created a shared repository called [`notion-scripts`](https://github.com/kevinjalbert/notion-scripts) to further help the development of my tooling for Notion ([blog post](https://kevinjalbert.com/introducing-notion-scripts/)).

I consolidated all my Notion related projects into this repository ([`notion-toolbox`](https://github.com/kevinjalbert/notion-toolbox)), to increase the cohesion and interactions between the tools. Over time I've slowly pivoted away from the Notion template I put together, and this has led to a revamp of what I want notion-toolbox to do. The new vision is to allow for greater flexibility and to be more generic.
